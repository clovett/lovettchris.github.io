# Update to XML Notepad

As  XML has exploded across the planet I continue to get many requests for improvements to my XML Notepad of 2007.  The tool has been downloaded over a million times, so I figured it's time to show it some love and fix some bugs.  In the process I updated it to NET 4.0 using VS 2013.  I was amazed how everything from back then still works, including the Unit Tests.  That is pretty amazing platform compatibility.  Windows is a great platform and Visual Studio is still best of breed for software development, and I still love C#.

I also posted the source code on [github.com/microsoft.xmlnotepad](https://github.com/microsoft/xmlnotepad).

See [Install Page](https://microsoft.github.io/XmlNotepad/#install/).
