# Coyote - solving complexity of async code

I'm happy to announce the availability of a very cool new .NET Framework and testing tool from
Microsoft Research called [Coyote](https://microsoft.github.io/coyote/learn/overview/what-is-coyote).  I am super fortunate to be
able to work with some of the smartest people in the world at [Microsoft
Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/) and Coyote is a perfect example of the kind of
really cool projects I get to play with.

Coyote (which started out as the P# programming language) is the result of a new `incubation`
process in Microsoft Research that takes research work and moves it to the next level, like a
startup company would, to turn research into useful product.  We do this by pairing researchers with
Software Engineers, Program Management, Design, Business Development, and Marketing, who all work
together to deeply understand the research, how to present it to the world in a way that is easy
to understand and use and how work with customers to improve it.

Coyote already has customers inside the Azure team that are using it to improve the quality and
reliability of Azure infrastructure.  If you are drowning in the complexity of building asynchronous
software, then you probably need to add Coyote to your toolbox.

Check it out, it is free, open source on github, with a [nuget
package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Coyote/) ready to use in your .NET projects!
