## Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020

The new [Microsoft Flight Simulator](https://www.flightsimulator.com/) is nuts!

Can you believe the screen shot below is simulated?  I snapped this while flying over Woodinville
in the simulator with max settings which I can do because I have a nice powerful desktop with
NVidia 1080 GPU.  So far I am super impressed that I can fly the entire planet.  These guys
have timed this perfectly what with all the covid-19 lockdowns and everything!
