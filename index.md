Hi, 

My name is Chris Lovett.  I love writing code and starting new projects on small fast paced incubation teams and growing that to successful product.  I’ve done this several times in my career and had a blast in the process.  I enjoy working with Microsoft Research and I am co-inventor on 16 patents.  But while solving hard technical problems is fun, I’ve also learned that in the end it is the people I work with that make all the difference.  So my goal is to apply my talents on an amazing team and make the world a better place.
